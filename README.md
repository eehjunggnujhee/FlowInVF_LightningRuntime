# Host Flow in a Visualforce page with Aura Component dependency

## To Change
1. Have your screen flow ready and activated (Your flow should not have required input parameters to start the interview; this template is not built to supoprt it. ex. I need to start the flow interview with a list of selected records from the page)
2. LINE 31: Replace the flow API name to your target flow [flowVF](force-app/main/default/pages/flowVF.page)
3. provide access to the flowVF for relevant community user profiles.
4. link or embed your flowVF from your site
